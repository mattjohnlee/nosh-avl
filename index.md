	<p><strong>As of March,</strong> we will be pausing on Saturday morning deliveries in order to focus on what the next version of Nosh will be. Whether that’s a pick-up model or local pop-ups is still TBD, but please follow us on Instagram to be the first to know! (After us, that is.)</p>

	<p>We’re so grateful for your support during our first few months of testing these malty waters. Thank you to everyone who placed an order, gave us your feedback, and showed us that there’s a demand in Asheville for classic Jewish baked goods. We can’t wait to share our food again soon and give you something to nosh on!</p>
